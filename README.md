## Build and Pack 

If you prefer to build the extension from source code, First things first, we should install the project dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

Then build the extension:

```sh
yarn run build
```

It creates a directory called "build". After that, using the official [Testing and Debugging](https://dev.opera.com/extensions/testing/) guide, pack the extension. Done.


## Collaboration

Please, feel free to ask any questions that you have about using and developing the extension.

Good luck.
